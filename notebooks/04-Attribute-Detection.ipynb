    "# Attribute Detection\n",
    "In the last notebook, we used a statistical NLP model to extract clinical events such as problems, treatments, and tests. However, just because a report mentions a clinical concept doesn't mean that a patient actually has that concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important task in clinical NLP is **attribute detection**, which involves looking for clues around a concept that indicate whether a concept is:\n",
    "- Negated\n",
    "- Historical\n",
    "- Uncertain\n",
    "- Experienced by someone other than the patient (such as family history)\n",
    "- Hypothetical (something that could occur in the future)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways for doing this: using **contextual analysis** or by identifying which **section** in a note it occurred in. We'll cover the former in this notebook and see some examples of section detection in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `ConText`\n",
    "### The ConText algorithm\n",
    "One method for performing this analysis is the **ConText** algorithm. This algorithm was originally proposed in this paper: [Context: An Algorithm for Determining Negation, Experiencer, and Temporal Status from Clinical Reports](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2757457/) by Harkema et al. ConText is an extension of the NegEx algorithm, which is very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with medspaCy, there are several implementations of ConText and clinical NLP systems which use ConText, including:\n",
    "- [cTAKES](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995668/)\n",
    "- [Leo](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/Leo/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How ConText works\n",
    "\n",
    "ConText connects certain **modifiers**, such as **\"no evidence of\"** or no **\"is negative\"**, with the target concepts we are extracting. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "There is **no evidence of** **_pneumonia_**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this sentence, the **target** is **_pneumonia_**: this is the clinical concept we are trying to extract. The **modifier** is **no evidence of**: this shows that the concept is **negated**. \n",
    "\n",
    "ConText finds these targets and modifiers in text and builds **relationships** between them. Here is a visual representation of the graph ConText would create out of this sentence:\n",

    "    - **\"BIDIRECTIONAL\"** - This is the default and the modifier will apply to targets on both sides of the modifier\n",
    "    - **\"FORWARD\"** - The modifier will modify any targets *after* the modifier\n",
    "    - **\"BACKWARD\"** - The modifier will modify any targets *before* the modifier\n",
    "    - **TERMINATE\"** - Any modifiers will stop at this point, such as **\"but\"** in \"No evidence of pneumonia or pleural opacities **but** he has PE.\"\n",
    "- **`pattern`**: An optional spaCy pattern to match, like we saw in the pattern-matching notebooks\n",
